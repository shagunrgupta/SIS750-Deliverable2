# Introduction

By 2031, an estimated 600 million Indians will be living in urban areas, comprised on megacities such as Delhi, as well as smaller cities and towns that have emerged to meet the demands of a rapidly urbanizing population. While existing literature on democracy and decentralization establishes that citizens’ trust in local institutions is essential for effective delivery of public goods and services, we also know that local state capacity to respond to India’s rapidly urbanizing population remains limited. 

What explains variation in public trust in local democratic institutions, specifically the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), among citizens living in conditions of high urban informality?  

# Methods

The preliminary pilot survey comprised of 264 households across 8 unauthorized colonies in Southeast Delhi, combined with interviews with neighborhood association leaders in each colony. 246 households responded to the question on trust in the MCD. 

The survey was conducted with a team of 5 enumerators using a mobile data collection application (Kobo ToolBox). The figure below provides a distribution of household responses based on level of trust.   

```{r methods figure}

  filter(trustscale != 0) %>%

                   breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels=c("Distrust it greatly", 
                            "Tend to distrust it", 
                            "Not sure/don't know", 
                            "Tend to trust it", 
                            "Trust it a great deal")) +

# Results

The following figures show the relationship between trust and gender, trust and religion, trust and caste, trust and income, and trust with the presence of a Residents' Welfare Association (RWA) which is a type of neighborhood association in India.

RWAs are tasked with representing residents within a specific community. They often liason with local authorities on issues such as sanitation, cleanliness, infrastructure including schools and hospitals. The preliminary data suggests that having a RWA is correlated with higher levels of trust.

The table below presents results from a set of cumulative link models. The presence of a RWA is a significant predictor of higher levels of trust in government (along the ordinal scale). Especially interesting for this project is the highly significant and positive effect of trust in local political leaders, suggesting that trust in political leaders may also predict trust in local authorities even though the MCD's work is not understood to be political in nature. This finding merits further inquiry in the next stage of the research.

# Discussion 

Results show that women, Muslims and Scheduled Tribes tend to distrust the MCD. On the other hand, higher income is associated with higher levels of trust. A key finding is that the presence of a Residents' Welfare Association (RWA), a type of neighborhood association is associated with higher levels of trust. This is also established through the cumulative link model regression results. In addition,being male and having trust in local political leaders is associated with higher levels of trust in the MCD. 

# Conclusion and Next Steps

The preliminary results establish that there is indeed variation in trust in the MCD based on religion, caste and income. This study doesn't control for additional factors such as level of education. Next steps in the project include a larger survey of ~1,200 households across South and East Delhi combined with an expanded set of interviews with neighborhood association leaders and residents.
